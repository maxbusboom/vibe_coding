We will program the game Ass-teroids. This game will be just like the game
Asteroids, but the asteroids will be shaped like buttocks.

Implementation Constraints: This game will be written in HTML and Typescript.
There will be a single index.html file in the root of the project that will load
the game. The game will be a single page application, but may involve multiple
Typescript files. I also want an NPM package.json file, with a start script that
will run the game.
